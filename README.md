FeedFrenzy - The Scala version
==============================

After the previous rewrite from Ruby on Rails to Java (Play), it is time for the next step.
This time I'll rewrite the application in Scala.

The backend will use an implementation of [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/), Akka Streams.

The front-end will be Spray, or the new Akka HTTP combined with AngularJS.
